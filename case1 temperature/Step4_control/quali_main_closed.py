# Note that due to the nonconvexity, the solver not being able to find a solution doesn't mean that the problem is infeasible.
# This function is used to check if the solution from the last time step is feasible when the solver cannot find a solution at the current time step.
# Note that if it reports that "Sorry, we still cannot find a solution at time k", it still doesn't mean that the problem is infeasible, since we only apply x and u from the last time instant. I am too lazy to extract and then apply all the variables that used in the optimization problem from last time instant. 
# in the folder "Step4_control", we separately wrote the qualitative and quantitative versions of the control problem. Actually, they can be easily combined. (too lazy to work on it)
